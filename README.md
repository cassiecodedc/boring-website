# Hi! This is my first project!
# In this project, I share my ongoing story about playing badminton in the DMV area. Despite my enthusiasm, I often find it challenging to play badminton with my friends due to the scarcity of convenient facilities. This project highlights that story. It's not a complete tale but rather a developing one. However, it's a good start!

# I categorized data from three well-known gym brands by scraping their addresses from their websites and converting them into GeoJSON format. This process resulted in over 500 data points. I then imported the GeoJSON data into QGIS to create a refined map and select various icons to illustrate my points. As I became more familiar with QGIS, I added plugins to acquire maps of the DMV area.

# For the website, I used templates from Soma and Katrina Ventura's Columbia Encampment to implement scrollytelling using JavaScript and HTML. I adjusted some settings for width and layout but am still not entirely satisfied with how it appears and exits. I'll continue to refine this aspect.

# Reflecting on my project, I realize I wish I had done more analysis on badminton courts and other sports facilities besides badminton. I plan to conduct more research and provide summaries and suggestions on sports diversity in the DMV area in the future.
